# Introduction to Logic

These resources are intended as study aids for a course in Introduction to Logic. The material is derived by Erik Hoversten from [*Language, Proof, and Logic: 2nd ed.*](https://ggweb.gradegrinder.net/lpl/) by Dave Barker-Plummer, Jon Barwise, and John Etchemendy.

The pages can be viewed at [erikhoversten.org/intro-logic/](http://erikhoversten.org/intro-logic/)

The proof pages implement a script for revealing steps one at a time. A hint can be accessed by hovering over the line reveal link. This script is intended to help students learn proof strategies though examples.

Some of the lectures rely on the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation framework.
