Course overview
---------------

This is an introductory logic course. We will explore general logical
notions such as *truth*, *validity*, and *soundness* in a rigorous and
*formal* way.

Logic is *topic neutral*.

-   The idea here is that the principles of logic we are looking at are
    very general, and apply no matter what specific topic (such as
    politics, physics, or TV shows) we are discussing.
-   Thus, there is a high reliance on *abstraction*, and we use
    *symbols* to stand in for specific nouns and verbs in our logical
    sentences.
-   So, much of what we do will look a lot like what you might see in a
    math class, specifically *algebra*.

We will introduce a couple specific *logical systems*, define *rules*
that govern those systems, and use the rules to construct *proofs* of
various *theorems* within the system.

Homework
--------

-   6 homework assignments, only 5 will be graded, lowest throuwn out
-   Homework submitted through Grade Grinder using the textbook software
-   You must have access to the software to do the homework. This means
    you have to purchase the book.
-   You can enter practice submissions to the system and get feedback as
    many  
     times as you want. So, you should have no trouble getting full
    credit for the assignments.
-   You officially submit your homework for credit by including the
    instructor email: *ruphil201s15@gmail.com*
-   Late homework assignments will be docked **3 points** for every day
    they are past due.

Exams
-----

-   Midterm exams will be taken in class on the dates indicated.
-   The final exam will take place on the scheduled final exam date for
    this  
     class. It will take place in this room.
-   The exam format will include multiple choice, fill in the blank, and
    short answer. You will also be expected to show proficiency with the
    logic tools we examine, such as *truth tables*, *proofs*, and
    *determining validity*.
-   Make up exams will only be given under extenuating circumstances,
    and provided that the student informs me of their need to miss the
    exam ahead  
     of time.

Formal Logic
============

-   A *formal logical system* is a tool for investigating a specific
    kind of human reasoning in a rigorous, objective way.
-   Logical systems are defined by the **language** we use to express
    the statements and rules of the system.

Defining the language
---------------------

-   All languages have three main components:
    -   Vocabulary: the basic meanginful units of the language (*the
        words*)
    -   Syntax: the rules for putting basic units together to form
        larger meaningful units (*the sentences*)
    -   Semantics: the rules for assigning meanings to the sentences
-   This is true for *natural* languages (English, Tagalog) as well as
    the formal languages we will investigate.
-   But formal languages are different in that the rules of the language
    are *rigorously* and *explicitly* determined before we start using
    them.

Using the language
------------------

-   Logical languages are interesting in their own right. But their main
    function is to help us explain what makes for good and bad
    **reasoning**.
-   The primary tool of reasoning is the **argument**. Arugments
    involve:
    -   Premises: one or more sentences used as the foundation of the
        reasoning.
    -   Conclusion: a sentence that is the end point of the reasoning.
    -   Support relation: the explanation of how the premises *lead to*
        the conclusion.
-   Thus, we also need our language to define *relations between
    sentences* to explain how good arguments work.
-   Using the components we defined earlier, we can do just that:
    -   Syntactic relations: ways to *transform* one sentence into
        another one.
    -   Semantic properties of sentences: *tautology*, *contradiction*
    -   Semantic relations between sentences: *equivalence*,
        *consequence*

The language of FOL
-------------------

-   Our textbook introduces us to the language of *first order logic*,
    or **FOL**.
-   Over the course of the semester, we will:
    -  Introduce a basic bit of the language FOL, 
    -  Expand it with greater vocabulary, 
    -  Explore the properties and functions of the language, and
    -  Use the language to model elements of human reasoning.
