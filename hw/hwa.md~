    = 16

    x 4 (for each name as the first argument) = 64 total sentences

    *The student does not need to list all of the sentences of this language. They need only give the correct number.*

3.  If n = number of names, then number of sentences = n<sup>2</sup> per binary predicate. So, 4 names and 4 binary predicates = 4<sup>2</sup> x 4 = 64 sentences.
